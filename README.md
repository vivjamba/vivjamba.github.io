## Vivien's Portfolio

### Hey everyone! This is my very simple, personal website. 

#### You can access it online at vivjamba.github.io


#### Or run it yourself using npm (though I'm not sure why you would):

1. Pull this repo in whichever way you prefer
2. Make sure you have [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and you are using node v20 or later (I like to use github.com/Schniz/fnm to handle my node versions!)
3. Open your terminal and run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

**Compile and Minify for Production**
This website is hosted statically using Github Pages using
`npm run build`
